# About me ⚡

I’m a programmer focused on Ruby. Although Ruby is a high‑level language, I make time to deepen my understanding of what happens closer to the operating system as well

# My interests 😁

#### Backend Development

* API development (Monoliths & Microservices)
* Troubleshooting & observability in distributed systems
* System Design (Scalability, Reliability, Maintainability)
 
#### Data Structures and Algorithms

While my main focus is backend engineering, I regularly work on data structures and algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving skills

# Interpersonal Skills 🌱

#### Communication

I like to provide regular asynchronous updates through messages. This approach helps a wide audience stay informed about my work and brings greater clarity to what I am doing

#### Teamwork

I enjoy supporting others' ideas when they ask for my help. It's a good way to explore different perspectives and maintain an open mindset. I believe there will always be opportunities to put my own ideas into practice when the time is right

#### Time management

# My Learning System 🧠

I learn by doing and by documenting everything I engage with. Hands‑on experience is the most effective way for me to retain skills, so I focus on practical application rather than passive consumption. I specialise in a small number of core subjects to build real depth, while still maintaining a broad awareness of adjacent areas to stay versatile and well‑rounded

# My Values ❤️

Respect and Honesty ALWAYS
