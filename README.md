# My Learning System 🧠

I created a personal learning system to document everything I study. I use `.rb` files to structure knowledge—writing class-based notes on tools, languages, and concepts ranging from Vim to GNU Bison to X11. This helps me think through code and organize large amounts of information efficiently

### Example: Vim

```
class Vim
  def grep
    [
      ":grep",
      ":grep colima -r ."
    ]
  end
end
```

### Example: Repositories

```
class Bitbucket
  def private
    [
      # list private repos
    ]
  end

  def public
    [
      # list public repos
    ]
  end
end
```

This approach is inspired by how FreeBSD maintains everything in one tree. I am currently experimenting with managing multiple repositories while keeping my single-repo philosophy

Why do I do it this way?

**Simply because I enjoy it**
