# About me ‚ö°

I am a Ruby developer focused on backend systems, especially in API design and system observability. I am currently diving into Java to expand my skills

# My interests üòÅ

#### Backend Development

* API development (Monoliths & Microservices)
* Troubleshooting & observability in distributed systems
* Databases and system design
 
#### Data Structures and Algorithms

While my main focus is backend engineering, I regularly work on data structures and algorithms to sharpen my problem-solving skills

# Learning System

I am developing my own learning system

I arrange my thoughts using code. I have a primary repository (private access) where I create documentation in .rb files about anything that I research including subjects like algorithms, GNU Bison, English and X11. When I say 'anything', I mean it ‚Äî from algorithms to English grammar. The advantage of having a single repository for everything is the simplicity to manage large amount of code, a public example of what I am talking about is the FreeBSD src

Giving examples to have a taste of it

#### If I am learning Vim, I can create a vim.rb file with the content

```
class Vim
  def grep
    [
      ":grep"
    ]

    # example grep
    [
      ":grep colima -r ."
    ]
  end
end
```

#### If I am creating repositories, I have something like

```
class BitBucket
  def private
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end

  def public
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end
end

class GitHub
  def private
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end

  def public
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end
end

class GitLab
  def private
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end

  def public
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end
end
```

Why do I make effort in doing that? The simple answer for this question is: Simply because I enjoy it

I am studying ways to handle many repositories (private and public access) for my researches. I still think that having a single repository is better than multiple repositories, I just want to challenge myself to understand the influences of doing that in a practical way
