# Learning System

I created a personal learning system to document everything I study. I use `.rb` files to structure knowledge‚Äîwriting class-based notes on tools, languages, and concepts ranging from Vim to GNU Bison to X11. This helps me think through code and organize large amounts of information efficiently

### Example: Vim

```
class Vim
  def grep
    [
      ":grep"
    ]

    # example grep
    [
      ":grep colima -r ."
    ]
  end
end
```

### Example: Repositories

```
class BitBucket
  def private
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end

  def public
    [
      # list repositories
    ]
  end
end
```

This approach is inspired by how FreeBSD maintains everything in one tree. I am currently experimenting with managing multiple repositories while keeping my single-repo philosophy

Why do I do it this way?

**Simply because I enjoy it**

# My values ‚ù§Ô∏è

Respect

Honesty
