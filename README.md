# About me ⚡

I am a software engineer primarily focused on Ruby. While Ruby is a high-level language, I make a conscious effort to deepen my understanding of what happens closer to the operating system

## My interests 😁

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING = [
  "API development (Monoliths & Microservices)",
  "Troubleshooting & observability in distributed systems",
  "System Design (Scalability, Reliability, Maintainability)"
]

PLATFORM_ENGINEERING = [
  "CI/CD",
  "Infrastructure provisioning"
]
```
